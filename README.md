## Getting Started

This is the Java code for battle ship game written during the Oriented-Object Programming course.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources. It contains the package `battleship`
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
